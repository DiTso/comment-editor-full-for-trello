# Trello-outliner

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

**Want to test this Power-up?**

Follow these instructions:

1. Go to [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)
2. Pick the team with which you'd like to test Trello Outliner (you can create your own, with only yourself inside)
3. Click on *Create New Power-Up*
4. In the *Power-Up Name* field, type `Outliner (test)`
5. In the *Manifest URL* field, type `https://trello-outliner-github.glitch.me/manifest.json`
6. Then, press *Save*.
7. Go to one of your Trello boards that belong to the team you had picked in step 2
8. Open a card that contains at least one comment (or create one)
9. Click the *Outline* button on the right of the card, in the Power-ups section
10. Click the comment that you'd like to edit => it should open a new tab that allows you to edit that comment (without Markdown formatting, for now)
11. In that tab, make a simple change (e.g. add some text), then press *Save*
12. Back to your Trello tab, the comment should have been updated.

If you notice any problem, please contact me at adrien.joly (@) gmail.com, and tell me what step fails, and how.

**Want to remix the Trello Outliner Power-Up and really make it your own?**

You're in luck. Once you remix this, you'll want to take a look at what the new name is. Click the `Show Live` button up in the top bar and grab that url. You'll want to add `/manifest.json` to the end of it and then head here:

[https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)

Select the Trello team you want to add the Power-Up to. Note: You need to be an admin of the Trello team to add custom Power-Ups to it.

Now click the `Create new Power-Up` button. If this is your first time creating a Power-Up, you'll need to agree to a "Joint Developer Agreement" first. After you have done that, you just need to give your cool new Power-Up a name, and paste the manifest url link in (the one you created earlier).

Click `Save` and it's time to celebrate ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ

Now when you look at the Power-Ups for any board in that team, your awesome new Power-Up will be available. You can continue to make changes to the Glitch project and you'll see that reflected in Trello (you may just need to refresh).
