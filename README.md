â–¶ More details: [Submission on Atlassian's Codegeist](https://devpost.com/software/trello-outliner-lpv3zt)

â–¶ Source code: [Glitch](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/trello-outliner-github) (*feel free to remix it!*)

### For whom was it designed for, and why?

Trello Outliner is made for people who leverage Markdown-formatted comments to take and edit structured notes.

It extends that experience with:

- a full-screen editor, for more focus / less distractions
- WYSIWYG Markdown editing
- outliner-like indentation of bullet points
- prevent you from accidentally aborting changes without saving

Still not getting it? ðŸ¤” If you want to know more about my Trello-based productivity workflow, read "[Work on 12 projects without burning out ðŸ”¥ â€“ Be Yourself](https://byrslf.co/work-on-12-projects-without-burning-out-f5bec50dafdb)".

### Development and production flow

Everytime a commit is pushed to the `master` branch, it's also pushed to the glitch server, thanks to [glitch-github-sync](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/glitch-github-sync). Check glitch's logs for status and errors.
