üèÜ This Power-up was [submitted to Atlassian's Codegeist](https://devpost.com/software/trello-outliner-lpv3zt). Go give it some love if you enjoy using it!

### For whom was it designed for, and why?

Trello Outliner is made for people who leverage Markdown-formatted comments to take and edit structured notes.

It extends that experience with:

- a full-screen editor, for more focus / less distractions
- WYSIWYG Markdown editing
- outliner-like indentation of bullet points
- prevent you from accidentally aborting changes without saving
